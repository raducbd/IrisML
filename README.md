# Iris ML Django Project

Welcome to the Iris ML Django project! This project demonstrates how to build a web application using Django for predicting iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Features

- **Prediction Form**: Fill out the form with sepal and petal measurements to predict the iris flower species.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The prediction is made using a pre-trained machine learning model trained on the Iris dataset.
- **Django Framework**: Built with Django, a high-level Python web framework, for efficient development and deployment.
- **Responsive Design**: The web app is designed to be responsive and work seamlessly on various devices.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd iris-ml-django`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
7. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`.
2. Fill out the form with sepal and petal measurements.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to see the predicted iris flower species.
